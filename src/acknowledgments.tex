\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors Alessandro Ottaviano, Robert Balas and Michael Rogenmoser who supported me throughout the project. They provided me with technical guidance and also supported me in the planning of the project as a whole.

Furthermore, I have to thank Per Lindgren and his team of the university of Lule√• in Sweden, who developed the first version of RTIC, the real time operating system we ported to RISC-V. Without their amazing previous work, this project would not have been possible at all.

And finally, I would like to give my thanks to my friends and family who supported me emotionally through the course of the project.
