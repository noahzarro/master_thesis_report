\chapter*{Abstract}

The abstract summarizes what this report is about.
It focusses on the big picture and does not go into details.
You should write concisely about the following points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe the \textbf{background} of your project: what is the motivation for your project and why is it important?
  \item Describe the \textbf{objectives} of your project.
  \item Describe the \textbf{problems} that must be addressed to achieve the objectives---why are these problems difficult?
  \item Describe your \textbf{approach} and \textbf{methods}.
  \item Summarize the most important \textbf{results}.
  \item State the main \textbf{conclusion} and its significance.
\end{itemize}

The abstract typically takes half a page and should not be longer than one full page.
Try to write a draft of the abstract early on to have a good idea of your project, but revise the abstract as the project progresses.
Write the final version of the abstract once the report is otherwise complete.
