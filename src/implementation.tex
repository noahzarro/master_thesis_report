\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter explains your contributions, be it algorithms, architectures, libraries, hardware, or others.
As usual, follow a top-down approach and break the chapter into meaningful sections.
It may even be necessary to split the chapter into multiple chapters (e.g., to separate architecture from implementation in a hardware design).

Derive a structure for this chapter that is meaningful for your report and discuss it with your advisors.

\section{Libraries}
\label{sec:libraries}
Since RISC-V support is minimal in the Rust embedded world, several libraries had to be created or extended.
First, the RISC-V \gls{mac}, had to be extended with support for the \gls{clic}. Furthermore, in the runtime crate, the vector tables needed to be set up such that they were compatible with the \gls{clic}. Finally, we also had to implement a macro (the Rust equivalent of a function attribute) to specify interrupt handlers.
